What is IOKE?

Project scope entails development of a crowdfunding / donation platform using blockchain technologies. The platform will have its own coin (IOKE Coin) forking, using PIVX standards. The objective of the project is to support the development of small business for women, across the world. 

1. Focus on female entrepreneurs & existing/aspiring small business owners.  
2. Anyone can register; pending verification
3. The funds received should be used for specific business project, with clear description and amount indicated in the application form. 
4. Securing funding through other businesses & investors


How it works? 

Each project should register to the website and submit an application form, with the short description of the project and any other additional information they would consider useful, to increase support from the community. 
All the projects will receive a small amount as sponsorship from the pool; amount to be determined, for example 2000 IOKE at the beginning. 
Users can select a project they like and finance that project with the amount of their choice in IOKE coin (in future can TIP in BTC, ETH, FIAT) or send funds to portal budget.
Once a month, there will be a poll on the website and the project with the most votes will receive a bonus from the pool, like 10000 tokens. This is a method to increase popularity and visibility of the website, as projects may invite their friends to vote. Each voter should only be able to vote one time only (IP verification / email needed). 
All the received funds will be stored in the project wallet(if not cold storage?), user creating the project would be the administrator (for more security they can have also option to add their own IOKE address and fund's will be sent directly).
We are still thinking about the possibility of rewards for the users, to stimulate them to tip the projects. This can be also determined in cooperation with its project, according of the business profile, the level of the project etc.
